# hello-world
This is my first repository as I follow Github Guide. I'm new to coding and have been teaching myself how to code for about a year. I have learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The newest language I am in the process of learning is Python. I really enjoy coding with Python and looking forward to learning more. 

print("Hello World!")
